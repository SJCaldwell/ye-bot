[Verse: Ameer Vann]
Praise God, all my niggas free and gettin' money
I keep my hand on a swivel, know they lookin' for me
I ain't hidin' from bitches
Know they lyin' 'bout niggas
Ain't no truth to the rumors
This ain't no rap that I'm spittin'
This the blood of my niggas
This the tears of my mother
It's the voices I'm hearin'
When I'm smokin' alone
I bought the work off my cousin
With my boyband money
Called it business investments
We was raised up reckless

This the blood of my niggas
This the tears of my mother
It's the voices I'm hearin'
When I'm smokin' alone
I bought the work off my cousin
